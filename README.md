HV-Inv is a computer code for forward calculation and inversion of H/V spectral ratios of ambient noise (HVSRN) based on the diffuse field assumption (DFA). It takes advantage of the recently stated connection between the HVSRN and the elastodynamic Greenâ€™s function which arises from the ambient noise interferometry theory. The software supports joint inversion of HVSRN and dispersion curves by using several local and global algorithms: Monte Carlo sampling, simulated annealing, downhill simplex and interior-point.

It has been written in Matlab R2015a

The exe folder contains compiled fortran code for the forward computation of H/V under the diffuse field approach.
The source code for that vile is available at https://github.com/agarcia-jerez/HV-DFA

Note that the definition of H/V used in this software is:

where Ex represents the directional energy density of the component X (North, East or Vertical), that is, adding the horizontal components, not averaging.
